## What's in the Box

This repo is a **Terraform mono‑module** that spins up every Google Cloud resource Look‑see needs to crawl a site, run automated accessibility audits, and stash the results in a Neo4j graph database. In less time than it takes to microwave leftover pizza you'll get:

* A private **Neo4j Community** instance (or the URI of an existing one) (see [Module Overview](#module-overview) and [Example Usage](#example-usage) for details).
* A fleet of **Cloud Run services** (crawler, auditor, notifier, and a tiny API gateway) (see [Module Overview](#module-overview)).
* **Pub/Sub topics** that glue the micro‑services together (see [Module Overview](#module-overview)).
* **Secret Manager** entries for DB creds, SMTP, and Pusher keys (see [Module Overview](#module-overview)).
* **Service accounts** with minimum‑viable IAM roles.
* **Cloud Build** pipelines that build and deploy container images on every tag push.

*If you're curious how the pieces dance together, jump to the 60‑second tour below.*

---

## Architecture

Everything is 100% serverless so you only pay while the containers are awake.

---

## Prerequisites

* **Google Cloud account** with billing enabled.
* **Terraform 1.6+** – any newer release is fine.
* **Google Cloud SDK** (`gcloud`) authenticated against your project.
* **Docker** – Cloud Build can build for you, but local Docker makes debugging faster.
* **Node 18+** – only needed if you hack on the micro‑services before pushing.
* **A Neo4j Aura instance** (free tier works) or credentials to an existing cluster.

> *Need a refresher on CI/CD? Peek at my AWS blog post "Anatomy of a CI/CD Pipeline" for extra context.*

## Required Google Cloud APIs

Enable these once per project (replace `${PROJECT_ID}`):

```bash
gcloud services enable \
  run.googleapis.com \
  cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  pubsub.googleapis.com \
  secretmanager.googleapis.com \
  compute.googleapis.com \
  --project=${PROJECT_ID}
```

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/deepthought42/LookseeIaC.git
$ cd LookseeIaC

# 2. Export the bare‑minimum variables
$ export TF_VAR_project_id="my‑gcp‑proj"
$ export TF_VAR_region="us‑central1"
$ export TF_VAR_environment="dev"

# 3. Export your secrets (see next section)
$ export TF_VAR_neo4j_username=neo4j
$ export TF_VAR_neo4j_password="super‑secret"
$ export TF_VAR_neo4j_bolt_uri="bolt+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io"
$ export TF_VAR_neo4j_db_name="neo4j"
$ export TF_VAR_smtp_username="postmaster@example.com"
$ export TF_VAR_smtp_password="s3ndM3Mail$"
$ export TF_VAR_pusher_key="app-key"
$ export TF_VAR_pusher_app_id="app-id"
$ export TF_VAR_pusher_cluster="us3"

# 4. Initialise and deploy
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan -out=tf.plan
$ terraform apply tf.plan
```

The first run takes about 5‑7 minutes while Cloud Build cooks the container images.

When `terraform apply` finishes it prints the public HTTPS URL of the API gateway and crawler service. Hit `/healthz` on either endpoint to confirm they're alive.

## Configuration

All tunables live in **`variables.tf`**. You can override them via `terraform.tfvars` or environment variables.

### Root Variables

| Variable                             | Description                      | Default       |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------- |

| `region`                             | Primary region for all resources | `us‑central1` |
| `environment`                        | Tag applied to every resource    | `dev`         |
| `neo4j_bolt_uri`                     | BOLT URI to your Aura instance   | –             |
| `neo4j_username` / `neo4j_password`  | DB creds                         | –             |
| `smtp_username` / `smtp_password`    | SMTP creds for outbound email    | –             |
| `pusher_app_id`                      | Pusher application ID            | –             |

| `pusher_secret`                      | Pusher secret (sensitive)        | –             |

> **Heads‑up.** Changing `environment` triggers *new* resources rather than updating in place. Handy for blue‑green swaps, but noisy if you do it by accident.

## Module Overview

- **modules/neo4j‑db**: Provisions a Neo4j Community Edition VM (using a startup script to install Neo4j, set an initial password, create a database, and run a CQL schema file (e.g., "create‑indexes‑and‑constraints.cql") at startup). Access is controlled via firewall rules (e.g., SSH via IAP) and VPC.
- **modules/cloud_run**: Deploys Cloud Run services (with VPC connector, Pub/Sub integration, and secret management) for micro‑services 
    - [Page Builder](https://github.com/deepthought42/PageBuilder) - Navigates to a web page and extract page html, elements, screenshots, and css
    - [Journey Expander](https://github.com/deepthought42/journeyExpander) - Expands valid journeys into a list of journey candidates
    - [Journey Executor](https://github.com/deepthought42/journeyExecutor) - Validates journey candidates and
    - [Audit Manager](https://github.com/deepthought42/AuditManager) - Orchestrates the audit workflow by coordinating between different audit services, managing audit state, and handling audit lifecycle events
    - [Audit Service](https://github.com/deepthought42/audit-service) - 
    - [Content Audit](https://github.com/deepthought42/contentAudit) - Performs automated content audits by analyzing text content for readability, accessibility, and SEO best practices. It checks for proper heading hierarchy, alt text for images, link text quality, and content structure to ensure web content meets accessibility standards and provides a good user experience.
    - [Visual Design Audit](https://github.com/deepthought42/visualDesignAudit) - Analyzes visual design elements of web pages for accessibility and usability best practices. It evaluates color contrast ratios, text sizing, spacing, visual hierarchy, and responsive design implementation to ensure the visual presentation meets accessibility standards and provides an optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
    - [Information Architecture Audit](https://github.com/deepthought42/informationArchitectureAudit) - Analyzes the structural organization and navigation patterns of websites to ensure optimal information hierarchy and user experience. It evaluates site maps, navigation menus, breadcrumbs, and content organization to identify potential improvements in how information is structured and accessed, helping ensure users can efficiently find and navigate to desired content.

- **modules/pubsub**: Manages Pub/Sub topics (e.g., "url", "page‑created", "page‑audit", "journey‑verified", "journey‑discarded", "journey‑candidate", "audit‑update", "journey‑completion‑cleanup", "audit‑error") and push subscriptions (for Cloud Run endpoints).
- **modules/vpc**: Sets up a VPC (with a custom subnet) and firewall rules (e.g., SSH via IAP, internal traffic for Neo4j, etc.).
- **modules/secrets**: Manages Secret Manager entries (for Neo4j, SMTP, Pusher, etc.) so that sensitive data is never stored in Terraform state.
- **modules/security/service_perimeter**: (Optional) Configures a VPC Service Controls perimeter (e.g., "regular" or "bridge") to restrict access to GCP services.
- **modules/api**[https://github.com/deepthought42/CrawlerAPI]: Deploys the API gateway (Cloud Run) for Look-see services.

## Example Usage

### Deploying Neo4j Community

Below is an example Terraform snippet for deploying a Neo4j Community instance using the `neo4j‑db` module. (Adjust variables as needed.)

```hcl
module "neo4j_db" {
  source             = "./modules/neo4j‑db"
  project_id         = var.project_id
  region             = var.region
  zone               = var.zone
  vpc_network_name   = var.vpc_network_name
  machine_type       = "e2‑medium"
  image              = "ubuntu‑os‑cloud/ubuntu‑2204‑lts"
  disk_size          = 20
  tags               = ["neo4j"]
  neo4j_username     = "neo4j"
  neo4j_password     = var.neo4j_password
  neo4j_db_name      = "looksee"
  service_account_email = google_service_account.neo4j_instance_sa.email
  environment        = var.environment
}
```

**Notes:**
- The startup script (e.g., "install‑neo4j.sh") (or inline metadata_startup_script) downloads (e.g., via curl) a CQL file (e.g., "create‑indexes‑and‑constraints.cql") from your repository (or a public URL) and runs it (using `neo4j‑admin run`) to set up indexes and constraints.
- SSH access is enabled (via IAP) by default (using a firewall rule that allows TCP port 22 from Google Cloud IAP (`35.235.240.0/20`)).
- (Optional) You can also deploy a Cloud Run service (using the `cloud_run` module) that connects to this Neo4j instance.

---

## Project Structure

- **create‑indexes‑and‑constraints.cql**: (Located in the root folder) A CQL file (executed on the Neo4j VM) to create indexes and constraints.
- **variables.tf**: (Root) Defines variables (e.g., project_id, region, environment, secrets) for the entire project.
- **modules.tf**: (Root) Calls the Terraform modules (e.g., "neo4j‑db", "cloud_run", "pubsub", "vpc", "secrets", "api").
- **terraform.tfvars**: (Root) (Optional) Override variables (e.g., project_id, region, environment, secrets) for local or CI/CD use.
- **iam.tf**: (Root) (Optional) Defines IAM bindings (e.g., for service accounts).

---

## Local Dev & CI/CD

- **Local smoke test:** Each service (e.g., crawler, auditor, notifier, API) has a `make dev` (or equivalent) that builds and runs the container with mock environment variables.
- **CI/CD:** Pushing a tag (e.g., "v1.2.3") triggers Cloud Build (which builds the Docker image, pushes to Artifact Registry, and re‑deploys the Cloud Run service). (The pipeline YAML lives beside each service so you can tweak build flags without touching Terraform.)

---

## Security & Secrets

- Secrets (e.g., Neo4j password, SMTP, Pusher keys) are **never** baked into Terraform state. Everything sensitive is stored in Secret Manager (and referenced by resource ID).
- Every Cloud Run service owns a dedicated **service account** (with the smallest IAM role needed (e.g., Pub/Sub publisher or subscriber)).
- Firewall rules (e.g., for SSH (via IAP), internal traffic (for Neo4j), etc.) are configured (e.g., via the `vpc` module) to restrict access.
- (Optional) A VPC Service Controls perimeter (e.g., "regular" or "bridge") (via the `security/service_perimeter` module) can be used to restrict access to GCP services.

---

## Neo4j Schema Management

The `neo4j‑db` module (using a startup script (e.g., "install‑neo4j.sh")) downloads a CQL file (e.g., "create‑indexes‑and‑constraints.cql") (from your repository (or a public URL)) and runs it (using `neo4j‑admin run`) at startup. Update the file (or its URL) to change the schema (e.g., create indexes and constraints).

---

## Cleaning Up

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Terraform tears down every resource (including Artifact Registry images). (Neo4j Aura lives outside GCP, so kill that instance from the Neo4j console if you spun up a temporary cluster.)
